Specification Pattern â€”Â what it's about and why we should use it.

Not so long ago, I joined a logistics project with quite a legacy codebase. 
Eventually, we updated the project to PHP 7 and then to PHP 8. 
That wasnâ€™t a big deal since there were literally no dependencies.

The real struggle was maintaining business rules.
Basically, a lot of `if {} else {}` statements, lists, code duplication, etc.
These rules werenâ€™t fixed, some rules work fine today, but tomorrow conditions change, and we need to adjust the code.
For example, today, the EU is one list of countries, but after Brexit, itâ€™s another one.

Things got even messier because we spoke with clients in different languages. 
They called certain conditions/rules one way, and we called them another. 
It was clear we needed a common language that both sides could understand.

Thatâ€™s when I remembered the beautiful and simple **Specification Pattern** â€” a perfect fit for our problem. 
Plus, itâ€™s super handy even between developers.

## Building a Specification Library

I wanted to introduce specifications, so I started looking for a good and simple PHP library. 
Unfortunately, everything I found was either overengineered or didnâ€™t meet our criteria â€” PHP 5.5 at the time, no dependencies.

So, I built my own, focusing on simplicity, high composability, and avoiding fancy modern PHP features that wouldnâ€™t 
work on older PHP versions and didnâ€™t bring much benefit anyway.

## Why Use Specifications?

At first, it might seem like overkill. But trust me, the value becomes clear over time.
Take a simple example: **Shipment goes to the UK**.
You could implement a `Shipment::toUK(): bool` method, but that quickly becomes messy. Youâ€™ll end up with a ton of helper methods cluttering your entity. A better approach is to encapsulate this logic in a specification:
```php
class ShipmentToUk extends AbstractSpecification {
    /**
     * @param Shipment $candidate
     * @return bool
     */
    public function isSatisfiedBy($candidate)
    {
        return $candidate->getDesctination() == 'UK';
    }
}
```
That worked for a while, but then the client said:
> Well, we consider Jersey and the Isle of Man as part of the UK too.

No problem! Just tweak the specification:
```php
class ShipmentToUk extends AbstractSpecification {
    /**
     * @param Shipment $candidate
     * @return bool
     */
    public function isSatisfiedBy($candidate)
    {
        return in_array($candidate->getDestination(), ['UK', 'GB', 'JE', 'IM']);
    }
}
```
Boom! One small change, and it applies everywhere. 
Plus, now everyone understands what **Shipment goes to the UK** actually means.

## Composing Specifications

Next, letâ€™s introduce a **High-value UK shipment** specification.
First, we define a **High-value** specification:
```php
class HighValue extends AbstractSpecification {
    public function __construct(private CurrencyConverter $currencyConverter) {}

    /**
     * @param Shipment $candidate
     * @return bool
     */
    public function isSatisfiedBy($candidate)
    {
        return $this->currencyConverter->toGBP($candidate->getValue()) > 300;
    }
}
```
Then, we combine it with **Shipment goes to the UK**:
```php
$highValueUkShipmentSpecification = new AndSpecification([
    new ShipmentToUk(),
    new HighValue(new CurrencyConverter())
]);
```

## The Real Benefit

Now, imagine your system is using these specifications everywhere, and the client suddenly says:
> We noticed the system doesnâ€™t recognize Guernsey as part of the UK. We need to fix this.

No problem at all! You only need to update **Shipment goes to the UK**:
```php
return in_array($candidate->getDestination(), ['UK', 'GB', 'JE', 'IM', 'GG']);
```
Done! Changes reflected on **Shipment goes to the UK** specification as well on **High-value UK shipment**.

## Final Thoughts

The Specification Pattern keeps business rules clean, encapsulated, and easy to adjust. 
No more hunting for messy `if {} else {}` statements. 
Just tweak the relevant spec, and the change propagates across the system.

Give it a try â€” youâ€™ll thank yourself later. ðŸ˜Ž
