I started this blog with the simple idea of a place to store my notes about different aspects of programming,
project management, other things related to development.
<br><br>
My main programming language is PHP, so most of the posts are going to be in context of PHP.
I have been working with it since 2011. So, I have something to say ðŸ˜‰.
The main areas of experience are gambling, advertising, analytics, and logistics.
